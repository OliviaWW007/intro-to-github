3. What platform do they host their code on?

## Question: What have you learned about your case study:

Group 1 (case study 1): Linux
1. License: General Public Licence.
3. Benefits: Linux can be developed by various different developers for free. Security is far better, more user customisability
5. Platform: Kernel.org/ Github

Group 1.2 (case study 1): Linux
1. License: Public Domain.
2. Benefits: more 'eyeballs' = more likely to identify bugs/backdoors. then fix those bugs.
3. Platform: Kernel.org/ Github

Group 1.2 (case study 1): Linux
1. License: Public Domain.
2. Benefits: Users can find bugs and fix those bugs.
3. Platform: Kernel.org/ Github.
