# GitHub Workshop Folder

Hello and Welcome to this Github Workshop!

This folder contains the materials and slides for the _Git Good: Introduction to GitHub_ workshop. 

## Contents
* [Widening-Participation-Git-Good-Workshop-2024.pdf]() is a pdf version of the slides from the workshop. You will be able to view these and use them as a reference after the session.
* [README.md](./README.md) is this document you're reading now! Remember that a README file is like the first page of a website - so when you open a folder (which is called a "directory") it's the document you are greeted with.
* [Widening-participation_Introductions.md](./Widening-participation_Introductions.md) is Exercise 2 about open source (the Widening Participation Summer School in 2024).
